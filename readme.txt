WordPress PlugIn with usefull extensions for speed, data privacy and optimization.

== Description ==

When we are working with our clients, there are a lot of usefull
settings, enhancements and scripts we recommend. To get them all
together, structured and easy to use, I have decied to build this
plugin.

It has a modular structure and covers a lot of different functions.
Nonetheless it's not intended to replace every other plugin or to
reinvent the wheel. Indeed it is meant as a fundamental (essential)
addition to WordPress that harmonically integrates with other
Plugins that are leader in their area.

It is written with speed, security and clean code in mind.
Help is very much welcome, as are recommendations for extensions and
code suggestions.

The main development is done on GitHub:
[https://github.com/kuetemeier/wordpress-plugin-kuetemeier-essentials](https://github.com/kuetemeier/wordpress-plugin-kuetemeier-essentials)

= The Basis version is and will be free =

There is a Pro Version available (in combination with an online
course), with additional Features and some more configuration
options. This is in closed Beta at the moment. However, it's
intended to guide the course members and to cover more complex and
demanding setups, that likely need more instructions, support and
personal coaching.

As said: the features implemented in this standard version will
always be free. The Pro Version is "only" and add on.

= With Speed in mind =

Every Plugin you install adds up to your page load time. So this
plugin was written with speed in mind: to be very fast on the
frontend part and quick enough on the admin part (e.g. admin stuff
is only loaded when there is an admin logged in).
